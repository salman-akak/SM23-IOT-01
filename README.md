# SM23-IOT-01
We connected the ESP32 to a power source and to a control panel Arduino IDE Programmer. We also have connected four output pins to a wifi connection in the code by ESP32 and identified with four LEDs, each one has a resistor in series. We programmed the ESP32 to turn on a specific LED when the robot moves in a specific direction, and turn off the LED when the robot stops. 

Using an Arduino IDE Programmer, we connected the microcontroller to a power source and a control panel. We also have written a code to connect the microcontroller to a Wi-Fi network. We connected four output pins of the microcontroller to four LEDs, each with a resistor in series. We assigned each LED to a specific direction of the robot movement (forward, backward, right, left) and turn on the corresponding LED when the robot moves in the chosen direction, by turning off the LED when the robot stops. 

The Components:
1. ESP32
2. 4 LEDS
3. 4 resistors
3. Wires to  connect

The code block starts with some include statements that import the libraries needed for WiFi, HTTP and serial communication. Then it defines a macro USE_SERIAL that refers to the Serial object. Next, it creates a WiFiMulti object that can handle multiple WiFi networks. Then it defines the setup function that runs once when the Arduino board is powered on. In this function, it sets four pins (27, 25, 26 and 18) as output pins, initializes the serial communication with a baud rate of 115200, prints some messages to the serial monitor, and adds a WiFi network with its SSID and password to the WiFiMulti object. Finally, it defines the loop function that runs repeatedly after the setup function. In this function, it checks if the WiFi connection is established, and if so, it creates an HTTPClient object that can send and receive HTTP requests. It uses this object to send GET requests to three different URLs: https://s-m.com.sa/b.html, https://s-m.com.sa/f.html and https://s-m.com.sa/r.html. These URLs are supposed to return either "backward", "forward" or "right" as the response body, indicating the direction that the robot should move. The code block then reads the response body and prints it to the serial monitor. Depending on the response, it sets the output pins to HIGH or LOW to control the robot's movement. For example, if the response is "backward", it sets pin 27 to HIGH and the rest to LOW, which makes the robot move backward. If the response is "forward", it sets pin 25 to HIGH and the rest to LOW, which makes the robot move forward. If the response is "right", it sets pin 26 to HIGH and pin 18 to LOW, which makes the robot turn right. The code block repeats this process for each URL in each loop iteration.
